It was implemented using OpenGL rendering engine with usage of Nvidia Cg language for vertex and pixel shaders. Program was implemented for the Winndows using Visual Studio. Several times after it I wished to port it to Linux, but it wasn't done yet.

To render objects all the vertex data was stored in video memory by using corresponding OpenGL extensions. For fast model loading (which was found in free libraries over the net) i developed special file format where data was stored similarly to its memory representation. And, it was necessary to write model in this format, so i developed special 3DS MAX plugin.

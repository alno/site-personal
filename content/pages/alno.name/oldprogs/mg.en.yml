title: Computer Graphics Task
description: |
  <p>This is my university task on computer graphics course, which was developed on second year (in 2005/2006).</p>

  <p>Before it, I studied environment rendering algorithms (terrain, water and sky). So, this work became most complex of what I developed in this area. And it became final for now.</p>

There was a very useful calculator in KDE3 built-in in the panel. It was possible simply to enter "2+2", press Enter and its content was changed to "4". However, there was not something similar in KDE4. There is Qualculate, but it has some drawbacks for me.

To solve this problem I created One Line Calculator. It's plasma widget which behaves similar to KDE3 panel calculator: you enter experssion, press Enter and calculator evauluate  it. Also, there are some additional features - as evaulation implemented through QScriptEngine in ECMAScript, you may extend set of defined functions in configuration dialog and make it suitable for your specific needs.
